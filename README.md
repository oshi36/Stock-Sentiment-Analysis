What is Sentiment Analysis?

Sentiment analysis (also known as opinion mining or emotion AI) refers to the use of natural language processing, text analysis, computational linguistics, and biometrics to systematically identify, extract, quantify, and study affective states and subjective information.

I had also published a research paper on 'sentiment analysis on news headlines for stock trend prediction' and has been added to this repository.
